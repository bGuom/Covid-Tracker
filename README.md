# Covid-Tracker
Contact Tracing Android Application 

## Abstract

COVID 19 is a global pandemic faced by many countries. It is an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Currently there are nearly 15 million covid 19 patients worldwide and the number is increasing everyday. This virus spreads from person to person through droplets generated when an infected person coughs,sneezes or talks. Healthy person in close proximity to an infected person could also get infected by breathing the virus droplets or by touching a contaminated area and then touching sensitive areas like eyes, nose or  mouth. 

To reduce the spread of COVID 19, it is advised to follow proper health and sanitization practices. Also it is important to promote social distancing as infectious virus droplets can not go more than a few feets in the air due to their weight. However it is difficult to keep social distancing in day to day life. As a solution to this problem, we came up with a mobile application to promote social distancing. Also this app can be used for contact tracing, So it will be easy to track  close contacts of a Covid 19 positive patient. 


## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Background of the application domain/ problem

COVID 19 is a huge problem faced by countries like Sri Lanka. It is important to prevent the spread of the virus through society. To accomplish this goal, social distancing and proper health practices need to be promoted among the general public.  This project is intended to develop a mobile application to fight Covid-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. This application will promote social distancing practice among users. The App will be able to trigger an alarm when two persons are closer than 1.5miters distance. Also it will track and store user interactions with other users. Thus those stored data may help to track all the users who have interacted with a Covid 19 positive patient.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution	

The proposed application is intended for use in the health and privacy domain. This mobile application will promote social distancing practice among users. The App will be able to trigger an alarm when two persons are closer than 1.5meters distance. Also it will track and store user interactions with other users for three weeks. Thus those stored data may help to track all the users who have interacted with a Covid 19 positive patient. Therefore it may help to make the quarantine process more efficient as well as effective. 

The system has basically two main components containing many sub components. A mobile application and a web server where it can store user ids and broadcast notifications and covid possessive patient ids to installed apps.. The application is basically developed as a solution to the social distancing issue and the covid 19 patient’s contact tracing app.

Most important feature of this system is that it does not send or collect user location data on a cloud server. Thus ensuring user data privacy and security. 
Originally it was proposed to use Bluetooth MAC address as a unique identifier or device which has active Bluetooth connection. 

Nearby users with active bluetooth connection will be identified as one of the following two encounters.

Close contact (Patient’s device was very close 0m -2m)
Same premises (Patient’s device has’t encountered a close contact, but it was within the range of bluetooth signal strength )

Depending on the category, the app users will be notified with guidance how to act to take the correct quarantine process and prevent Covid 19 from spreading to others. Also they will get required medical instruction regularly. But it’s solely their responsibility to respect these warnings and act accordingly.
